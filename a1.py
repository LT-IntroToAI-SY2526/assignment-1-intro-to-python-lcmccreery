AI-Generated Problem Set

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Document your original AI prompt below
2. Copy the problems your AI assistant generated
3. Implement solutions for each problem
4. Include comments explaining your approach
5. Test your solutions with different inputs

Remember: The goal is to LEARN, not just get working code!

MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class.I am new to programming. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover:

Variables and basic data types
Conditionals (if/elif/else)
Loops (for and while)
Functions
Basic list operations
Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs.

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

PROBLEM 1: Say Hello! (Variables and Data Types)
Write a program that stores your name and age in variables and then prints a message like:
"Hi, my name is Alex and I am 16 years old."

Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable
